# Dependencies
Required modules:
* http-proxy: used on sharding so the master server can act as a reverse-proxy and pass the request to slaves.
* mongodb-legacy: database driver.
* formidable: used when parsing requests to the form api.
* nodemailer: used to send e-mails for people resetting account passwords.
* nodemailer-direct-transport: used by nodemailer to send e-mails directly from the engine.
* parse5: used for handling DOM to create HTML from the templates.
* node-addon-api: used as a framework for the native functions.

The version of each one is specified on the package.json file.

A package.json file is included, so you can install all of them by just running `npm install` on this directory.

# Individual HTML cache
The engine will generate HTML caches for postings and log entries. These caches are for the whole cell containing the posting. Keep that in mind when developing, since it will be used unless the engine is running on front-end debug. You can flush them too, the command for doing so is in the list of arguments below.

# Application usage
`boot.js` is the main file, run it using Node.js to start the system. Keep in mind that if you ran `aux/setup.sh`, you can just run the `lynxchan` command or start the `lynxchan` service.
It accepts the following arguments:
* `--ip`, `-i`: ip. This ip will be used as the ip for all requests.
* `--tor-debug`, `-td`: tor debug. Will cause any request to be marked as a if it were coming from a TOR exit node.
* `--fe-debug`, `-fd`: front-end debug. Will not cache static files, disable individual HTML caches and reload the front-end templates.
* `--reload`, `-r`: will rebuild all pages on a running instance.
* `--reload-login`, `-rl`: will rebuild login page on boot.
* `--reload-banner`, `-rb`: will rebuild default banner on boot.
* `--reload-front`, `-rf`: will rebuild front-page on a running instance.
* `--reload-notfound`, `-rn`: will rebuild 404 page on boot.
* `--reload-thumb`, `-rt`: will rebuild generic thumbnail on boot.
* `--reload-audio`, `-ra`: will rebuild generic audio thumb on boot.
* `--reload-multiboard`, `-rbm`: will rebuild multiboard pages on a running instance.
* `--reload-spoiler`, `-rs`: will rebuild spoiler image on boot.
* `--reload-maintenance`, `-rm`: will rebuild maintenance page on boot.
* `--reload-maintenance-image`, `-rmi`: will rebuild maintenance image page on boot.
* `--reload-overboard`, `-ro`: reloads the overboard on a running instance.
* `--reload-logs`, `-rlog`: reloads logs on a running instance.
* `--reload-boards`, `-rboard`: reloads boards on a running instance. If a board uri is informed it will start from the informed board.
* `--reload-front-end`, `-rfe`: reloads the front-end files on a running instance, including cached static files. Will be ignored if maintenance mode is being changed on the same command or if no daemon was not informed.
* `--prune-files`, `-pf`: prunes files that no longer contains references to them. Its advisable to turn on maintenance mode before using this command to avoid race conditions.
* `--reload-graphs`, `-rg`: redraws daily graphs.
* `--no-daemon`, `-nd`: will not start listening to HTTP requests. For running commands while having a server running.
* `--create-account`, `-ca`: will create a new account. Require the use of the login, role and password parameters.
* `--login`, `-l`: informs a login.
* `--password`, `-p`: informs a password.
* `--global-role`, `-gr`: informs a role from 0 to 4, 0 meaning root user, 1 admin, 2 global volunteer, 3 global janitor and 4 regular user.
* `--set-role`, `-sr`: set a new role for an existing account. Will not be used if `-ca` is used. Takes a login and global role.
* `--maintenance`, `-m`: indicates a new value for maintenance mode on a running instance. The value will be parsed as JSON, so informing `true` or `false` will work, so as informing numbers that evaluate to false or true. Will be ignored if no daemon was not informed.
* `--disk-media`, `-dm`: disk media. If any boolean true value is passed, any media file on the db will transferred to the disk. Otherwise, any media file on the disk will be transferred to the db. Be warned to NOT RUN on slave nodes in a cluster and is also adviced to not have a daemon running while the transfer is ongoing.
* `--clear-individual-cache`, `-cc`: clears individual cache of postings and log entries.
* `--shutdown`, `-s`: orders a running instance to shut down. Will be ignored if no daemon was not informed or if either maintenance mode is being changed or if the front-end is being reloaded on the same command.
* `--set-password`, `-sp`: sets the password of the given account. Require the use of the login and password parameters.

Arguments that are meant to inform values should be used in the following manner:
`argument value`

Examples:
`lynxchan -r -nd` = rebuild all pages and do not start a server.
`lynxchan -ca -l login -p pass -gr 0` = create an account with login login, password pass with root global role and then start the server.
`lynxchan -rf -rb -nd` = reload the saved front-page and the default banner and do not start a server.

# Directory structure
The json api files will be stored on the `api` directory and accessed by the `/.api/` path. `/.api/function` will use the file `api/function.js`.
The form api for support of users without js because they are retarded tin foilers are in the `form` directory and are accessed using `domain/function.js`.
The `engine` directory will hold all scripts that provide functionality but are not to be accessed directly. There are also some few files directly under the `src/be` directory.
The `addons` directory are used to store the addons that can be loaded. After placing an addon on this directory, it should also be included in the `addons` general setting array.
And finally, the `settings` directory hold the settings files.

The following directories will be expected on the front-end directory:
* `static`: static files to be accessed by using the `/.static/` path.
* `templates`: will hold the templates, so only the files will have to be specified on the settings.

# Ban duration
The syntax for setting ban durations uses the following fields:
* `y`: year.
* `M`: month.
* `d`: day.
* `h`: hour.
* `m`: minute.

So if you write "2d 1h" it will create a 49 hour ban. The order of amounts and spacing doesn`t matter. The same could be "1h 2d".

# Templates
A file called `templateSettings.json` should be located on the front-end directory pointing the correct templates to be used, located on the templates directory. Inform only the name of the file. Refer to `doc/Templates.txt` for information on how to structure the templates.

# SSL
To use SSL, enable the setting `ssl` and place the key file named `ssl.key` and the certificate named `ssl.cert` on the src/be directories. Optionally, place the chain file named as `ssl.chain` to be able to provide the whole chain too. After that, restart the engine. Remember to also inform the key passphrase if it requires one.
